#### Configure DNS Provider

You can configure the DNS provider that will be used to lookup the URL IP address
```c
BearHttpsClientDnsProvider providers[] = {
    {.hostname= "dns.quad9.net",.route="/dns-query",.ip = "9.9.9.9",.port=5053},
    {.hostname= "dns.google.com",.route="/resolve",.ip = "8.8.8.8",.port=443},
    {.hostname= "dns.nextdns.io",.route="/dns-query",.ip = "217.146.9.93",.port=443},
};
int total_providers = sizeof(providers)/sizeof(BearHttpsClientDnsProvider);
BearHttpsRequest_set_dns_providers(request, providers, total_providers);
```

#### Using **getaddrinfo**

By default, the lib doesn't use **getaddrinfo** to resolve the URL IP but you can enable it by allowing it with the flag:

```c
#define BEARSSL_USSE_GET_ADDRINFO
#include "BearHttpsClientOne.c"
```

Note that these functions can generate memory leaks on some platforms, so use it with caution.

#### Configure Trusted Anchors

By default, the lib uses the trusted anchors of [Mozilla Trusted Anchors](https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem) generated by the **BearSSL/build/brssl tool** with the command **./BearSSL/build/brssl ta cacert.pem** and saves on file **dependenciesBearSSLTrustAnchors.h**. Check [BearSSL](https://bearssl.org/) for more information and [Build Code](/build/install_dependencies.lua) to see the build process. You can configure your own trusted anchors with the function:
```c
BearHttpsRequest_set_trusted_anchors(request, trusted_anchors, trusted_anchors_size);
```

#### Configure Known IPs
If you want to optimize the lib to not resolve the IP of the URL, you can configure the known IPs of the URL with the function:
```c
BearHttpsRequest *request = newBearHttpsRequest("https://example.com");

const char *known_ips[] = {
    "23.215.0.138",
    "23.215.0.136"
};
int known_ips_size = sizeof(known_ips)/sizeof(const char*);
BearHttpsRequest_set_known_ips(request, known_ips, known_ips_size);
```
**tip**: You can use sites like [ns.lookup](https://www.nslookup.io/) or [digital ocean dns tool](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tools/dns) to get the IPs of the URL.
