# Simple Example

The simplest example of using BearHttpsClient -- with the single file include [BearSSLSingleUnitOne.c](https://github.com/OUIsolutions/BearHttpsClient/releases/download/0.1.004/BearHttpsClientOne.c) -- is this example that fetches a page from example.com and prints it to the console.

```c
#include "BearHttpsClientOne.c"

BearHttpsNamespace bear ;
int main(){
    bear = newBearHttpsNamespace();

    BearHttpsRequest *request = bear.request.newBearHttpsRequest("https://example.com");
    BearHttpsResponse *response = bear.request.fetch(request);
    if(bear.response.error(response)){
        printf("Error: %s\n",bear.response.get_error_msg(response));
        bear.request.free(request);
        bear.response.free(response);
        return 1;
    }
    const char *body = bear.response.read_body_str(response);
    if(bear.response.error(response)){
        printf("Error: %s\n",bear.response.get_error_msg(response));
        bear.request.free(request);
        bear.response.free(response);
        return 1;
    }
    printf("Body: %s\n",body);
    bear.request.free(request);
    bear.response.free(response);
    return 0;
}
```
