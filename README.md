### Overview

BearHttpsClient is a lightweight HTTP/HTTPS client library for C/C++ applications. It provides a streamlined interface for network communication, eliminating the complexity of traditional networking code:

1. **Specify the target URL** 
2. **Retrieve the response**
3. **Process the data**

This library is designed for developers who need to:
- Download resources from remote servers
- Communicate with web APIs
- Retrieve data from online services
- Implement HTTP/HTTPS functionality in applications

### Key Features

- **HTTP & HTTPS support** - Secure communication with any web service
- **Simplified integration** - Single-file inclusion option
- **File transfer capabilities** - Efficient upload and download functionality
- **API compatibility** - Built-in support for JSON and modern web services
- **Cross-platform functionality** - Compatible with Windows, Linux, and WebAssembly
- **Minimal dependencies** - No additional library installations required
